1) the app is like a uni tracker :
- poor university applicants suffering from upcoming deadlines can use this app as a tracker all across the board.
- signup and login (account creation) verified via AppWrite's authintication system.
- list of the 8 Ivy Leauge unis, can scroll and discover them via search tool.
- each uni's required supplementall essay prompts are mentioned, discussed, and provided immense resources/ info on
- users can input all their grades and select the unis they like to get a status option
- grades and which uni lists with status updates are saved for each user specifically through AppWrite's applicant datatable


2) sadly I was only able to implement a few:
- valid signup and login, succsesfully connecting to appwrite authintacation and corresponding functionality
- listed the ivy leauges with horizontal scroll and search tool with descriptions only (didnt create repsective individual pages)
- users actually can input grades, just that I didnt manage to connect my datatable so more decorative end result

3)How to use: 
 - signup (you dont have an account but ill provide one just in case login is needed):
  -------> email: no2@gmail.com
  -------> password: nomit (or) nomit1221
  - when you access home page you can look around reading overviews of each uni, clicking to see individual in depth breakdowns (theoritcally for now).

  - you can click on the grades button to go to its corresponding page to input IB, Bugroot, SAT, ACT grades 
 - you can also click on profile to see you saved grades and uni aplication statuses (theortically for now)

 4) you know how to run just npx expo start:
 - works on both iphone and laptop (web) idk about android though

 5)I watched a couple of videos and expirminted first in total around 2 - 3 hours. the app itself took me three days working at least an hour and a half each day.
